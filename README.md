**Project Name**: Python Calculator  

A simple yet functional command-line calculator built in Python. This project supports basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—with the ability to chain calculations using the result of the previous operation. It features user input handling and a clean interface, making it an excellent learning tool for Python beginners. Key skills demonstrated include functions, loops, and basic error handling. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome!

### Issues with My Code

Here are the identified issues with my current Python Calculator code, along with explanations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Division by Zero Error**  
   - **Problem**: In the `div` function, if the user enters `0` as the second number (e.g., `10 / 0`), the program will crash with a `ZeroDivisionError`.
   - **Suggestion**: Add a check in the `div` function or before calling it:
     ```python
     def div(n1, n2):
         if n2 == 0:
             raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero!")
         return n1 / n2
     ```
     Then, wrap the division call in a `try-except` block to handle the error gracefully:
     ```python
     elif operator_selection == "/":
         try:
             result = div(first_input, second_input)
             print(result)
         except ValueError as e:
             print(e)
             continue
     ```

2. **Lack of Input Validation for Numbers**  
   - **Problem**: The code assumes users will always enter valid integers for `first_input` and `second_input`. If a user enters a non-integer (e.g., "abc"), it raises a `ValueError` and crashes.
   - **Suggestion**: Use `try-except` to validate numeric inputs:
     ```python
     while True:
         try:
             first_input = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
             break
         except ValueError:
             print("Please enter a valid integer.")
     ```
     Apply similar validation for `second_input` and the "no" branch of the continue prompt.

3. **No Exit Condition**  
   - **Problem**: The calculator runs in an infinite `while True` loop with no graceful way to exit (users must use Ctrl+C).
   - **Suggestion**: Add an exit option, such as allowing the user to type "exit" when selecting an operation:
     ```python
     operator_selection = input("\n +\n -\n *\n /\n Pick an operation (or 'exit' to quit): \n")
     if operator_selection == "exit":
         print("Goodbye!")
         break
     ```

4. **Case Sensitivity in Operator Selection**  
   - **Problem**: The operator input (e.g., `+`, `-`) is case-sensitive, but your continue prompt uses `.lower()`. This inconsistency could confuse users if they accidentally enter uppercase operators.
   - **Suggestion**: Convert the operator input to lowercase or explicitly check for exact matches:
     ```python
     operator_selection = input("\n +\n -\n *\n /\n Pick an operation: \n").lower()
     if operator_selection == "+":
         # Proceed as before
     ```

5. **Poor User Feedback for Invalid Operations**  
   - **Problem**: If the user enters an invalid operation (e.g., "%"), the program prints "Select the correct operation" and continues to the next iteration, but it doesn’t re-prompt for a valid operation immediately, which could confuse users.
   - **Suggestion**: Move the operation selection into a loop until a valid input is received:
     ```python
     while True:
         operator_selection = input("\n +\n -\n *\n /\n Pick an operation: \n")
         if operator_selection in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:
             break
         print("Please select a valid operation.")
     ```

6. **Code Structure and Clarity**  
   - **Problem**: The nested `while True` loop for the continue prompt works but makes the code harder to read and maintain.
   - **Suggestion**: Refactor the continue logic into a separate function:
     ```python
     def should_continue(current_result):
         while True:
             choice = input("Continue working with the previous result (yes or no): ").lower()
             if choice == "yes":
                 return current_result
             elif choice == "no":
                 while True:
                     try:
                         return int(input("Enter the first number: "))
                     except ValueError:
                         print("Please enter a valid integer.")
             else:
                 print("Please enter 'yes' or 'no': ")
     ```
     Then use it in the main loop: `first_input = should_continue(result)`.

7. **Lack of Docstrings and Comments**  
   - **Problem**: The code has no comments or docstrings, making it harder for others (or future you) to understand the logic.
   - **Suggestion**: Add a docstring to each function and comments where needed:
     ```python
     def add(n1, n2):
         """Add two numbers together."""
         return n1 + n2
     ```

8. **No Type Hints**  
   - **Problem**: Functions like `add`, `sub`, etc., don’t use type hints, which are a modern Python feature to improve readability and catch errors early.
   - **Suggestion**: Add type hints:
     ```python
     def add(n1: float, n2: float) -> float:
         return n1 + n2
     ```
     Use `float` instead of `int` to allow decimal inputs if desired.

9. **Untested Edge Cases**  
    - **Problem**: The code hasn’t been explicitly tested for edge cases like very large numbers, negative numbers, or zero (beyond division).
    - **Suggestion**: Test with inputs like `999999999999`, `-5`, or `0` as the first or second number to ensure the program behaves correctly. For example, Python can handle large integers, but it’s good to confirm.
